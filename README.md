- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lancerstup
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reading novels, learning new things, watching basketball, calm songs.
- ðŸŒ± I'm pretty confident on my vanilla javascript with the basics, I've also created few important project with just that so I moved on to learning a framework.
- Well, I got back learning the web dev as a whole, meaning with the back end included and some css frameworks. I think I'll move on to javascript frameworks later on.
